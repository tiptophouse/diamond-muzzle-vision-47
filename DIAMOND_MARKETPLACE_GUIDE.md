## üîß Technical Implementation

### Motion Sensor Integration

**Priority Order:**
1. **DeviceOrientation** (Best)
   ```typescript
   deviceOrientation.start((data) => {
     rotateX = data.beta; // Front-to-back tilt
     rotateY = data.gamma; // Left-to-right tilt
     rotateZ = data.alpha; // Compass direction
   });
   ```

2. **Gyroscope** (Fallback)
   ```typescript
   gyroscope.start((data) => {
     // Accumulate rotation velocity
     rotation.x += data.x * 0.5;
     rotation.y += data.y * 0.5;
   });
   ```

3. **Accelerometer** (Basic)
   ```typescript
   accelerometer.start((data) => {
     tilt.x = data.x * 10;
     tilt.y = data.y * 10;
   });
   ```

### Pinch-to-Zoom Implementation

```typescript
handleTouchStart(e) {
  if (e.touches.length === 2) {
    // Record initial distance between fingers
    touchStartDistance = distance(touch1, touch2);
  }
}

handleTouchMove(e) {
  if (e.touches.length === 2) {
    currentDistance = distance(touch1, touch2);
    scale = currentDistance / touchStartDistance;
    zoom = clamp(zoom * scale, 1, 3); // 1x to 3x zoom
  }
}
```

### Analytics Session Tracking

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const sessionId = crypto.randomUUID();
  const startTime = Date.now();

  // Track view start
  supabase.from('diamond_views').insert({
    diamond_id: stockNumber,
    session_id: sessionId,
    viewer_telegram_id: user.id,
    view_start: new Date()
  });

  // Track duration on unmount
  return () => {
    const duration = (Date.now() - startTime) / 1000;
    supabase.from('diamond_views')
      .update({ total_view_time: duration })
      .eq('session_id', sessionId);
  };
}, [stockNumber]);
```
