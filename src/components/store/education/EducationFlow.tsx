Key points about carat weight:
‚Ä¢ Larger diamonds are rarer and more valuable
‚Ä¢ Carat weight is measured to the hundredth of a carat
‚Ä¢ A 1.00 carat diamond is significantly more valuable than two 0.50 carat diamonds
‚Ä¢ Popular sizes: 0.25ct, 0.50ct, 0.75ct, 1.00ct, 1.50ct, 2.00ct+
‚Ä¢ Price increases exponentially with carat weight
‚Ä¢ Consider the finger size when choosing carat weight

Remember: Bigger isn't always better - balance size with quality.`

Clarity grades from best to least:
‚Ä¢ FL (Flawless) - No inclusions or blemishes visible under 10x magnification
‚Ä¢ IF (Internally Flawless) - No inclusions, only minor surface blemishes
‚Ä¢ VVS1, VVS2 (Very Very Slightly Included) - Minute inclusions very difficult to see
‚Ä¢ VS1, VS2 (Very Slightly Included) - Minor inclusions visible under 10x magnification  
‚Ä¢ SI1, SI2 (Slightly Included) - Inclusions visible under 10x magnification

Most diamonds have small natural birthmarks called inclusions.`

Cut grades:
‚Ä¢ Excellent - Maximum brilliance and fire
‚Ä¢ Very Good - Superior light performance  
‚Ä¢ Good - Above average light performance
‚Ä¢ Fair - Below average light performance
‚Ä¢ Poor - Minimal light performance

Cut quality factors:
‚Ä¢ Proportions - Relationship between size, angle and shape of each facet
‚Ä¢ Symmetry - Precision of the facet arrangement
‚Ä¢ Polish - Smoothness of the diamond's surface

A well-cut diamond will sparkle more than a poorly cut one of higher color or clarity.`
